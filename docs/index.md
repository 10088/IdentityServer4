# IdentityServer4 Documentation

IdentityServer4 is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core.

It enables the following features in your applications:

### Authentication as a Service
Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services).

### Single Sign-on / Sign-out
Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

### Access Control for APIs
Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and
native/mobile apps.

### Federation Gateway
Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directoy, Google, Facebook etc.
This shields your applicatios from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

### Customization everywhere
The most important part - every aspect of IdentityServer can be customized to fit **your** needs.
Since IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product of SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.
